# UPDATE POSTMAN COLLECTION FROM SWAGGER


This tools can update postman collection from swagger json, to avoid create every time.

> Note: The tools will merge old config with new, but for request body, it will keep the exist one, not merge.

### Use

2. Install packages

    Make sure you have install nodejs. Then in project root folder, run `npm install` to install libs.

3. Get your postman api key  
   Just open [this link](https://web.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) in your broswer, and generate your api key.

4. Set api key as environment.  
    Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` file, then set the api key you get in the previous step.
    
5. Rename `config/default-example.json` file to `config/default.json` and edit like bellow
   ```json
   {       
        "test":{
            "collection_name":"test import",
            "url":"http://127.0.0.1:8085/v2/api-docs"
        }
    }
   ```
    The key is command line value name.`collection_name` is the postman collection name you want to update. `url` is your swagger url.

6. Run update
